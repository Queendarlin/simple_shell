# Simple Shell Project
This simple shell project is designed to provide a basic yet functional command-line interface with some essential features. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, your contributions to this project are highly valued.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to create a UNIX-like shell that meets the following specifications:
- Display a prompt, then wait for the user to type a command.
- Execute commands entered by the user.
- Handle simple command lines with no advanced features.
- Handle errors gracefully.
- Implement built-in commands such as `exit`, `env`, `setenv`, `unsetenv`, `cd`, and `alias`.
- Handle command separators (`;`), logical operators (`&&` and `||`), and variables replacement.
- Support running commands from a file in non-interactive mode.

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Queendarlin/simple-shell.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd simple-shell`
3. Build the shell: `make`
4. Run the shell: `./simple_shell`

## Usage

Once the shell is running, you can enter commands. Here are some key points to remember:
- The prompt is displayed after each command execution.
- Commands are simple and consist of one word.
- Errors are handled appropriately, with informative error messages.
- Built-in commands (`exit`, `env`, `setenv`, `unsetenv`, `cd`, `alias`) are supported.
